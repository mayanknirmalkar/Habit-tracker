# Habit Tracker App

Welcome to the Habit Tracker App repository! This project is a simple and effective dashboard for daily and weekly habit tracking. The application has been developed using the EJS view engine for the frontend, with Node.js as the runtime on the backend. CRUD operations have been implemented to manage habits, and the data is stored in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- *Dashboard*: A user-friendly dashboard for tracking daily and weekly habits.
- *CRUD Operations*: Create, read, update, and delete operations for managing habits.
- *Backend*: Built with Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose for seamless integration with MongoDB.
- *Frontend*: Developed using EJS, HTML, and CSS for a responsive and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- *MongoDB*: A NoSQL database for storing and managing habit data.
- *EJS*: A templating language used for rendering dynamic content on the frontend.
- *Express.js*: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of robust web applications.
- *Mongoose*: An ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a higher-level abstraction for interacting with the database.
